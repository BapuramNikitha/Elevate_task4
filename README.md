# NotesApp

This is a simple notes app I built in Java.  
It runs in the terminal and lets you add and view notes.  
All notes are stored in a file called `notes.txt` so they’re saved even after you close the program.

## What it can do
- Add a note without losing your previous notes
- View all saved notes
- Store notes locally in a plain text file
- Simple menu so it’s easy to use

## How it works
The app uses:
- FileWriter→ to write notes to the file
- BufferedReader → to read notes from the file
- 

## How to run it
1. Make sure you have Java installed  
   Check by running:
   ```bash
   java -version
   javac -version

##  Example
